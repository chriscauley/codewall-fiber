# Codewall/Fiber challenge

I got about two hours into this before I decided I wasn't going to finish. I just don't need to practice css that much. You can see how far I got [on this project's GitHub page](https://chriscauley.github.io/codewall-fiber/). Most frustruatingly, the design uses very inconsistent spacing so I lose half of tailwind's power.
